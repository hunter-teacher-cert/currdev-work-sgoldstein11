Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). Include:
The name of the tool.
What its general purpose is.
The class(es) you use it in.
How you use it in class.
Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?


The first one is formative.com which is a tool that allows for assessment. I use it in all of my classes. I use it for homework, classwork and during lockdown I used it for timed-exams.Formative allows you do give students all types of question types --- the classical mc and free response. But students can also record their answer - they can draw a picture â€” they can do matching. Formative also allows you to tell if a student copy and pasted information from the internet.

As I do not currently teach a traditional CS class, I just started using micro:bits in my research class as a way of integrating CS into a non-cs class which is in this class is Science Research. This tool allows me to introduce coding to my students who have little or no experience. They get immediate feedback. They can write a simple "Hello, world" and the message will display on the device. I am going to use for students to develop a science research experiment. I chose this tool becuase it has a relatively low barrier to entry for students who have no experience yet. It is engaging and the devices themselves are inexpensive making them a winner in the classsroom.
