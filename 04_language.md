### What is the course? (grade level, student experience)

Science Research Class. In the summer I proposed that they would learn some HTML/CSS in order to present their science fair findings in a website. I'd like to enhance it with javascript.

### What is the language?

Javascript 

### How does one write & run code in this language?

It is written in an IDE and run from that environment. 

### Rate the complexity of the syntax?

The syntax is fairly straightfoward - more so than say C++ or Java. 

### Strengths

It is relatively easy to read and type and students can see instantaneous results of what they program. 

### How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?

Students would make webpages and have animation and see the result immediately. They would get immediate feedback. 

### Weaknesses

There is syntax so students would need to practice that. It is a bit more challenging than block coding. 

### How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?

I would practice some examples with students. 


### Why did you select this language for this class?

It is a good compliment to HTML/CSS.
