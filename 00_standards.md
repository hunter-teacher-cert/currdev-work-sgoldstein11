# Reviewing the NYS Standards in CS 

## 9-12.IC.1 Evaluate the impact of computing technologieson equity, access, and influence in a global society

## 9-12.IC.2 Debate laws and regulations that impact the development and use of computing technologies and digital information. 

I would have students read excerpts from the book <em>Weapon's of Math Destruction</em> and as a class we would vote on which topic mentioned in these excerpts we'd like to focus on for a Socratic Seminar. Topics could include models of recidivism for judges to determine prison sentences, teacher quality, credit worthiness etc. I would have students write a opening reflection on what they feel about the topic before taking a deeper dive into research. I would then have groups research both sides of the topic we chose and come up with pros/cons of the particular chosen area. 

On the day of the Socratic Seminar, I'd pick names out of a hat for who will be on the pro/con side and who will be debating in the middle of the circle. The rest of the class would sit in the outer circle evaluating the inner circle. 

At the end, students will need to make a reflection on what side they come down on after all the debate and research they have done. They will need to support their viewpoint with research they gleaned from both their own work and the information presented in the Socratic Seminar.

 The Socratic Seminar would be modeled off of this activity.

 ## 9-12.CT.10
Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation
features to inform collaborators and users.

Since I don't have a dedicated CS class this year, I will be doing a CS unit within my science research class. In introducing CS to the students I will be using [Microbits](https://microbit.org/)
