# New Course for Midwood High School


## General description of the course 

I would love to teach a class in HTML/CSS. I think this would be great for students who are looking to learn some coding and who are also visually creative and want to make something where they can combine both skills. I would like students to learn some HTML/CSS and then come up with a problem in our society that they'd like to make a solution for. The culminating project would be to design a website with their classmates that is involved with solving this societal problem. 

## Target audiance

Any student who wants to learn html and/or a student who wants to learn coding and also likes visual expression and has a creative side for design. 


## Where it fits along with the other courses in your school

We currently have APCSP and APCSA as well as python. We also have a media department in our school so I feel like this type of course would fit well in that context.
