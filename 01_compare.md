# Comparing two curricula

## I don't currently teach CS at my school so I will be comparing two curricula that were posted on slack. I will be comparing : Beauty and Joy of Computing and Code.org. 


## Major Differences:

While they do both mention the impacts on society of computing, it appears from looking at the curricla alone that BJC seems to emphasize the impacts on society of computing even more than code.org. While code.org does seem to have professional development for teachers it appears that BJc might have even more extensive training. For example, I saw that there was even a guide for first year teachers of the course that skips some of the non-required topics. This can be a great help to teachers who are the only CS teacher in their school and are just getting started with a program. It seems like this PD is really responsive to the needs of teachers and schools and wants to eliminate as many barriers for students to learn CS at various levels. 

## Major Similarities: 

They both follow the same basic structure for the curriculum in terms of units. Tney are both approved by the college board so in terms of making sure the teacher covers the required topics for students to sit for the exam - they both do a good job of that. They both a free to use and seem to have extensive professional development for teachers. 

## Comparative Strengths and weaknesses: 

They both have daily lesson plans and activities to get students started. It seems like both are very strong curricula to use in the classroom with rich examples and applications to real life. Having not used either its hard to gauge the quality of the professional development offered. But from the website, it appears that BJC might have more extensive training that meets teachers where they are in their journey of teaching APCSP.
